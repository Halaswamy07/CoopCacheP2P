Wireless P2P Cooperative Caching

Our project focuses on implementing cooperative caching in wireless P2P networks, including adhoc, mesh, and sensor networks. 
With applications in civilian and military domains, our approach optimizes data access and network performance.
We address design challenges, proposing asymmetric solutions to minimize data processing delays and enhance bandwidth utilization.
Our system improves file search efficiency and storage optimization, reducing client-side search times.
